			<h2>Method</h2>
			<p>throw the multiplier and no-risk dice first. Based on the currently thrown multipliers, you should start throwing the rest of your dice only if your total damage is lower as the value from the table. Currently it is assumed that its favorable to throw all the risky dice at once, if there are 2 unbalanced risky dice, it will overestimate.</p>

			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<p>These numbers purely gives the most damage per turn, it's the optimal for if the enemy has infinite health. To be able to finish off enemies, rounding up is generally slightly favored.</p>
			<p>Blablabla something about how zero-damage turns can screw you over, and how you can reduce them without much cost in DPT by using a (slightly) lower target damage.</p>
